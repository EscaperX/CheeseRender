Sample One Light
----------------
If there're many light sources in the scene, an easy and quick way is randomly sample one light and multiply it by the number of lights.
Which can be written as:
$$
\begin{equation}
E(L_1(X) + L_2(X) + \dots + L_n(X)) \approx \frac{n}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} n * L_{\text{sample}_i}(X)}
\end{equation}
$$
